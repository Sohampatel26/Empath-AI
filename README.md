# Personalized Emotional Support AI

## Overview
The Personalized Emotional Support AI is a sophisticated system designed to provide real-time emotional assistance through messaging apps. The AI utilizes two fine-tuned transformer models: one for mood summarization and another for offering coping mechanisms and personalized support. This project aims to deliver empathetic and effective support to users, helping them manage their emotions and improve their mental well-being.

## Features
- **Mood Summarization**: Detects and summarizes the emotional tone of the user's messages.
- **Coping Mechanisms**: Provides personalized coping strategies and support based on the detected mood.
- **Integration with Messaging Apps**: Seamlessly integrates with popular messaging platforms for real-time assistance.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensures user data is protected through robust encryption and anonymization techniques.

## Components
1. **Mood Summarization Model**
   - A fine-tuned transformer model designed to analyze text and summarize the user's emotional state.
   - Detects a range of emotions including happiness, sadness, anxiety, anger, and more.
   - Provides concise and accurate summaries to help understand the user's current mood.

2. **Coping Mechanisms Model**
   - Another fine-tuned transformer model that offers personalized coping strategies and emotional support.
   - Utilizes a rich database of mental health resources and expert advice.
   - Tailors responses to the user's emotional state, providing relevant and effective support.

## How It Works
1. **Message Processing**: When a user sends a message, the AI processes the text to detect emotional cues.
2. **Mood Detection**: The Mood Summarization Model analyzes the message and determines the user's emotional state.
3. **Response Generation**: Based on the detected mood, the Coping Mechanisms Model generates a personalized response, offering support and coping strategies.
4. **Real-Time Interaction**: The AI sends the response back to the user through the integrated messaging app, providing real-time emotional assistance.
